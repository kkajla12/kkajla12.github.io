title: About

I'm a software engineer by day and an entrepreneur/music producer/philosopher by night. This blog will be about things I (and hopefully you too) find interesting in life.

I'm currently working on modernizing real estate investing with [NineCap](https://www.nine-cap.com/), so I'll occasionally reflect on my learnings from that endeavor.
