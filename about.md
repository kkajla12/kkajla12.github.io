I'm an entrepreneur and a software engineer at heart. I'm a Co-founder at [Warrant](https://warrant.dev), where we're building the infrastructure for authorization. Previously, I built products and analytics platforms at companies like AppLovin and AppFolio.

In my free time, I enjoy producing music, traveling, playing basketball & tennis, and gaming. This blog will be about ideas I (and hopefully you too) find interesting in life.
